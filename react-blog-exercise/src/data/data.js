    title: "Lizard",
    text: `Lizards (suborder Lacertilia) are a widespread group of squamate
    reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents
    except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group is
    paraphyletic as it excludes the snakes and Amphisbaenia; some lizards
    are more closely related to these two excluded groups than they are to
    other lizards. Lizards range in size from chameleons and geckos a few
    centimeters long to the 3 meter long Komodo dragon.`,

    title: "Snake",
    text: `Snakes are elongated, limbless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes. 
    Like all other squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales.
    Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, 
    enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. 
    To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, 
    and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. 
    Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty-five times independently via convergent evolution, 
    leading to many lineages of legless lizards. These resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, 
    which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae).`,

    title: "Turtle",
    text: `Turtles are reptiles of the order Testudines, also known as Chelonia. 
    They are characterized by a bony or cartilaginous shell, developed from their ribs, 
    that acts as a shield. Testudines include both extant (living) and extinct species. 
    Among the turtles are included tortoises and terrapins. 
    Proganochelys of the Late Triassic is the earliest known fossil with a complete shell.`,

    title: "Crocodilia",
    text: `Crocodilia (or Crocodylia, both /krɒkəˈdɪliə/) is an order of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles, known as crocodilians. 
    They first appeared 95 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous period (Cenomanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, 
    as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. 
    Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, 
    and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), 
    the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). 
    Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, 
    crocodilians is a less ambiguous vernacular term for members of this group.`,

    title: "Dinosaur",
    text: `Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria. 
    They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago, 
    although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research. 
    They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201.3 million years ago; 
    their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. 
    The fossil record shows that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, 
    having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch, 
    and are the only dinosaur lineage to survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 million years ago. 
    Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs, or birds; and the extinct non-avian dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds.`,
